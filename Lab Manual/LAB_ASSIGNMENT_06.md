**Question 1:** Display empno, ename, deptno from employee table. Instead of displaying department numbers display the related department name (Use decode function for ORACLE and CASE for MySQL).

```sql
SELECT 
    EMPNO,
    ENAME,
    CASE DEPTNO
        WHEN 10 THEN 'RESEARCH'
        WHEN 20 THEN 'ACCOUNTING'
        WHEN 30 THEN 'SALES'
        WHEN 40 THEN 'OPERATIONS'
    END AS DNAME
FROM EMPLOYEE;
```

+---------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

**Question 4:** Display the current date as 15th August Friday Nineteen Ninety-Seven.

```sql
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(CURDATE(), '%D %M %W %Y') 
AS `CURRENT_DATE`;
```

```

**Question 5:** Display the following output for each row from employee table.

*Scott has joined the company on Wednesday 13th August Nineteen Ninety.*

```sql
SELECT 
CONCAT(
    ENAME,
    ' has joined the company on ',
    DATE_FORMAT(HIREDATE, '%W %D %M %Y')
) AS DETAILS
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE ENAME = 'SCOTT';

| SCOTT has joined the company on Thursday 9th December 1982   |
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

**Question 6:** Find the date for nearest Saturday after current date.

**Approach 1:** Using `WEEKDAY()`
```sql
SELECT DATE_ADD(
    '2026-02-22',
    INTERVAL MOD(5 - WEEKDAY('2026-02-22') + 7, 7) DAY
) AS NEXT_SATURDAY;
```

**Output:**
```
+---------------+
| NEXT_SATURDAY |
+---------------+
| 2026-02-28    |
+---------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

**Approach 2:** Using `DAYOFWEEK()`
```sql
SELECT DATE_ADD(
    '2026-02-22',
    INTERVAL MOD(7 - DAYOFWEEK('2026-02-22') + 7, 7) DAY
) AS NEXT_SATURDAY;
```

**Output:**
```
+---------------+
| NEXT_SATURDAY |
+---------------+
| 2026-02-28    |
+---------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

**Approach 3:** Using `CURDATE()`
```sql
SELECT DATE_ADD(
    CURDATE(),
    INTERVAL (5 - WEEKDAY(CURDATE())) DAY
) AS NEXT_SATURDAY;
```

**Output:**
```
+---------------+
| NEXT_SATURDAY |
+---------------+
| 2026-03-07    |
+---------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

> **Note:** The above code (Approach 3) is correct for days less than Saturday, but when the value becomes negative, it doesn't work.

**Question 7:** Display current time.

```sql
SELECT CURTIME() AS `CURRENT_TIME`;
```

**Output:**
